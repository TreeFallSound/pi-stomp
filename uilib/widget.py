# This is the root of all evil: the Widget class, parent of all things
# displayed on the screen.
#
# Note about attribute inheritance:
#
# Some attributes (mostly colors) can be inherited from the parent by not
# specifying them (or specifying them as None).
#
# For performance reason, this "parent lookup" is done when the widget is
# visible *and* is attached to a parent and cached. A widget can be attached
# when created (via the parent constructor argument) or attached later via
# the attach() method.
#
# A widget visibility is controlled by its hide() and show() method. A widget
# can only be made visible if it's bounding box has been established (non-None)
# 
# This means that the order in which you create the widget hierarchy matters,
# for example, if you create a widget C child of B, and later attach B to A,
# while you have A -> B -> C hierarchy, C will only inherit from B not from A
# unless C was invisible and only show()'n later.
#
# If no value is found in the parent, built-in defaults will be used
#
# For this to work, a subclass must call _init_attrs() **before** it calls
# super().__init__. This will ensure all attributes for the various subclasses
# are properly registered before Widget.__init__ adds the last ones and performs
# the initial parent inheritance.
#
# Note: "box" is an optional attribute at creation time. A widget without a box
# will start as invisible. A caller must then call Widget.set_box() and
# Wiget.show() later on to establish the bounding box and make it visible.
#

## TODO (in addition to the ones sprinkled in the code)
#
# - Consider clipping/cropping... this will be limited since we
#   can't really set clip rectangles in Pillow. Currently child that
#   go over the bounds of their parents are going to just do that...
#   with the resulting ugly consequences. There's an assumption that
#   widgets are well-behaved when it comes to boundaries. At least
#   when it comes to ContainerWidgets, we can (and somewhat do) do
#   something about it, but that's about it...
#
# - Placement / sizing. Do we want "auto-placement" ? Do we want a way to
#   represent things in term of percentile ? Or location of objects
#   relative to another object ? Or size relative to content (ie,
#   text widget size inherited from font) etc... ? This could lead to
#   more versatile layout for various screen sizes, but will be
#   harder to properly define.

    # Notes about drawing mechanisms
    #
    # Widgets rely on a parent having a backing image. Typically an instance of
    # ContainerWidget (such as a Panel).
    #
    # The main method for a widget subclass to override is the _draw() method.
    #
    # It takes as arguments the image to draw into, an ImageDraw instance for
    # that image (handy heh ?) and a Box instance which is bounds of the widget
    # in image coordinates (ie, with the appropriate offset applied based on
    # the location of the parent(s) of the widget).
    #
    # A widget can be refreshed explicitely by an external caller using the
    # widget's refresh() method. This will reach out to parents via _focus() and
    # _unfocus() to get the backing image and the right offset, allowing the widget
    # to redraw itself.
    #
    # As part of that process, a widget will also redraw all of its children if any,
    # which are going to draw their own children etc... via a chain of calls
    # to _do_draw().
    #
    # Note: The widget's _draw() method doesn't need to consider children, these
    # will be handled by the framework, so will be erasing of the backing prior
    # to drawing and the drawing of a boundary box and/or selection rectangle if
    # requested.
    #
    # refresh() is thus a complete redraw of a Widget and all of its children,
    # it's typically used after creating and populating a panel, or when updating
    # the content of an individual widget
    #
    # Another path through the object hierarchy is the slightly more complicated
    # _compose() path. _compose() is called by a ContainerWidget on its parent
    # when itself or one of its children have been updated. For example, a
    # ContainerWidget()'s _unfocus() calls the parent's _compose(). This is
    # specifically meant to "compose" the child Image into the parent Image (a
    # non-ContainerWidget parent will just pass "compose" up until it reaches
    # a ContainerWidget). This is an optimisation which allows only the portion
    # of the Image that was modified to be updated. This is very important on
    # SPI LCD displays where the refresh time can be very long if we try to
    # refresh too large regions.
    #
    # A Panel is basically a ContainerWidget subclass along with a mechanism
    # to handle "selection" of widgets (via a list of selectable widgets) and
    # which can be pushed onto a PanelStack.
    #
    # A PanelStack is the top of the graphical hierarchy and links panel(s) and
    # the LCD display. It "composes" the panels in the stack on top of each other
    # and routes user input to the current top-level panel. It is currently
    # a subclass of ContainerWidget but that might not always remain the case and
    # shouldn't be relied upon
    #
    # Note: Panels are always linked to a stack in order to be able to inherit
    # some attributes and for features like centering to work, as the bounding
    # box is established early and thus rely on the stack bounding box. When a
    # panel is popped off the stack, it still keeps its reference to said stack
